# Title

Uninitialized Storage Pointer

## Relationships

[CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html)

## Description

Uninitialized local storage variables can point to unexpected storage locations in the contract, which can lead to intentional or unintentional vulnerabilities.

## Remediation

Check if the contract requires a storage object as in many situations this is actually not the case. If a local variable is sufficient, mark the storage location of the variable explicitly with the `memory` attribute. If a storage variable is needed then initialise it upon declaration and additionally specify the storage location `storage`.

**Note**: As of compiler version 0.5.0 and higher this issue has been systematically resolved as contracts with uninitialised storage pointers do no longer compile.
