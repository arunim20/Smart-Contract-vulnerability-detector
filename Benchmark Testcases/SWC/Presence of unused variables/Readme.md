# Title

Presence of unused variables

## Relationships

[CWE-1164: Irrelevant Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1164.html)

## Description

Unused variables are allowed in Solidity and they do not pose a direct security issue. It is best practice though to avoid them as they can:

- cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption)
- indicate bugs or malformed data structures and they are generally a sign of poor code quality
- cause code noise and decrease readability of the code

## Remediation

Remove all unused variables from the code base.
