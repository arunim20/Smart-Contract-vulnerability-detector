# Title

Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction

## Relationships

[CWE-284: Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

## Description

Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.

## Remediation

Consider removing the self-destruct functionality unless it is absolutely required. If there is a valid use-case, it is recommended to implement a multisig scheme so that multiple parties must approve the self-destruct action.
