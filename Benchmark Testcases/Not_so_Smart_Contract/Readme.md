# (Not So) Smart Contracts

This repository contains examples of common Ethereum smart contract vulnerabilities, including code from real smart contracts. Use Not So Smart Contracts to learn about EVM and Solidity vulnerabilities, as a reference when performing security reviews, and as a benchmark for security and analysis tools.

## Features

Each _Not So Smart Contract_ includes a standard set of information:

* Description of the unique vulnerability type
* Attack scenarios to exploit the vulnerability
* Recommendations to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
* Real-world contracts that exhibit the flaw
* References to third-party resources with more information

Bonus! We have also included a repository and analysis of several [honeypots](honeypots).
